CS180 Lecture 13: File I/O
memory (ram) is volatile - lost when power lost
Storage (disks, tapes, DVD-ROMS, thumb drives, etc) is non volatile - maintains data without power
Program: inert version of code (stored in storage), Process: the execution of the program (stored in memory)
java provides and abstraction for interacting with files and the file system (class File)
but, file name is OS/FS dependent
directory conventions are OS/FS dependent

All files are just collections of bytes, we give these bytes meaning
disks are very slow: most of the time we try hard to not access the disk.
most file operations are buffered: reads lots of data from storage to memory

Java File I/O
low leve: FileOutputStream
HighLevel: DataOutputStream

File class:
File f = new File("data.txt");
methods: canExecute(), canWrite(), canRead(),
delete() etc.
